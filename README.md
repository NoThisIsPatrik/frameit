WIP Video Frame Proc
This is a very rough sketch of routine for extracting and processing frames from a video file.

It now uses postgres, expecting a postgresql db named framedb to exist.
It does not process frames in parallel
It is written in python3, not C/C++

There are there parts:

* initpostgres.py - Creates two tables, frames and csv_lines, to store frames and output lines in
* framesplitter.py - Splits a video file into keyframes, storing it in postgres under table "frames"
* frameprocessor.py - Process each keyframe, splitting into cells, calculating their median grayscale value, write the result to csv_lines, and deletes the frame from table frames
* outputmaker.py - Reads csv_lines and writes it to a csv file

Next up will be to redo frameprocessor.py in C++, and make it run in parallel.

To this end, there are now further files:

* cfp.cpp - proof of concept using libpgxx to access postgresql via C++, iterating over the frames made by framesplitter
* procj.cpp - PoC using libjpeg to decompress a jpeg file already in memory (as though it had been pulled from postgres) and do something to arbitrarily sized squares of it. At the moment, it turns it grayscale, and maxes the red and green component on alternate squares. Writes to smpl.ppm as a debug output.
* test.jpg - A picture of my cat, Potassium, used by procj.cpp
